# Add an Activity

The "Activities" that appear on the main page are set in the "Activities" section in the left sidebar menu

* To add a new activity type, scroll down to the bottom of the activities forms and click the button (TODO: What button, where??) to add a new row
* Fill out the row and add an image if possible (remember that photos need photo releases and photographic portraits of fewer than 3 people need model releases)
* Scroll up to the top and click "Update"
