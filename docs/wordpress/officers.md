# Update Officers

The officers list is managed by clicking on "Officers" in the left column of the admin dashboard.

* There are already entries for most or all current offices. Edit the existing office form to update that listing on the website.
* If a new office has been formed, you can make a form for it by scrolling to the bottom and clicking (TODO: need to look up this process)
* If a vacant office is expected to be vacant for a while, you can delete the form for it and add it back later on.
